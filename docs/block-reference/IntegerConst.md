## Overview
The `IntegerConst` Block outputs a predefined integer value that is configured when the Block is set up. This Block is useful for providing constant numeric values, counters, limits, or configuration parameters in your workflows. The integer value is specified in the Block's configuration and remains constant throughout execution.

## Example(s)

### Example 1: Output a simple integer constant
- Create an `IntegerConst` Block.
- Configure the output value: `42`.
- The Block will output: `42`.

### Example 2: Provide a port number
- Set up an `IntegerConst` Block.
- Configure the value: `8080`.
- The Block will output `8080`, which can be used as a port configuration for other Blocks.

### Example 3: Set a maximum limit
- Create an `IntegerConst` Block.
- Configure the value: `100`.
- The Block will output `100`, useful for setting limits in loops or processing constraints.

### Example 4: Use negative integers
- Set up an `IntegerConst` Block.
- Configure the value: `-5`.
- The Block will output `-5`, demonstrating support for negative integers.

### Example 5: Use zero as a default
- Create an `IntegerConst` Block.
- Configure the value: `0`.
- The Block will output `0`, useful as a default count or starting value.

## Error Handling
- The `IntegerConst` Block has minimal error handling requirements since it outputs a pre-configured static value.
- If a non-integer value is provided during configuration (e.g., a string or decimal), the Block configuration will fail.
- The Block will always output the exact integer value that was configured.
- Very large integers are supported within Python's integer limits.

## FAQ

???+ question "Can I modify the integer value after the Block is configured?"

    No, the `IntegerConst` Block outputs a constant integer that is set during configuration. If you need dynamic integer values, consider using other blocks or mathematical operations.

???+ question "What's the range of integers I can use?"

    Python supports arbitrarily large integers, so there's no practical limit to the size of integers you can configure. However, extremely large values may impact performance in downstream operations.

???+ question "Can I use decimal numbers with IntegerConst?"

    No, `IntegerConst` specifically works with integers only. For decimal numbers, you would need a different constant block or convert the value using mathematical operations.

???+ question "How does this differ from other constant Blocks?"

    `IntegerConst` specifically outputs integer numbers, while `StringConst` outputs strings and `DictConst` outputs objects. Use `IntegerConst` when you need numeric values for calculations, counters, or configuration parameters.

???+ question "Can I use this for mathematical operations?"

    Yes, the integer output from `IntegerConst` can be used directly in mathematical operations, comparisons, and any Block that expects numeric input.

???+ question "What happens if I configure it with a very large number?"

    Python handles arbitrarily large integers, so very large numbers are supported. However, consider the practical implications for downstream Blocks that might have their own limitations.
