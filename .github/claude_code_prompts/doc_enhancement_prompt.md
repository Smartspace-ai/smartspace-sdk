# Documentation Enhancement Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for enhancing auto-generated block documentation with practical examples, error handling information, and useful FAQ entries.

## Overview

The goal is to transform basic auto-generated documentation into comprehensive, user-friendly guides that help developers effectively use each block in their workflows.

## Enhancement Requirements

### 1. Examples Section

For each block, provide 2-3 practical examples that demonstrate:

- **Basic Usage**: A simple, straightforward example showing the most common use case
- **Advanced Usage**: An example showcasing advanced features or configurations
- **Integration Example**: How the block works with other blocks in a workflow

#### Example Format:
```markdown
### Example 1: [Descriptive Title]
- **Setup**: Brief description of what this example demonstrates
- **Configuration**: Key settings used in this example
- **Input**: Sample input data or connection
- **Expected Output**: What the block will produce
- **Use Case**: When you would use this configuration
```

### 2. Error Handling Section

Document common errors and how to handle them:

- **Input Validation Errors**: What happens with invalid inputs
- **Configuration Errors**: Common misconfigurations and their fixes
- **Runtime Errors**: Errors that might occur during execution
- **Recovery Strategies**: How to handle failures gracefully

#### Error Documentation Format:
```markdown
- **Error Type**: Brief description of when this error occurs
- **Common Causes**: List of typical reasons for this error
- **Solution**: How to fix or prevent this error
- **Example**: Code or configuration that demonstrates the fix
```

### 3. FAQ Section

Add 3-5 frequently asked questions that address:

- **Common Confusion Points**: Areas where users often get stuck
- **Best Practices**: Optimal ways to use the block
- **Performance Considerations**: Tips for efficient usage
- **Limitations**: What the block can and cannot do
- **Troubleshooting**: Quick solutions to common problems

#### FAQ Format:
```markdown
???+ question "Question text here?"
    
    Answer in 2-3 sentences, providing clear and actionable information.
    Include code examples or configuration snippets where helpful.
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone and Voice
- **User-Centric**: Focus on what the user wants to achieve
- **Clear and Concise**: Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
- **Actionable**: Provide specific steps and examples
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledge common pain points

### Content Structure
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use headers, lists, and formatting effectively
- **Scannable**: Make it easy to find specific information quickly

### Technical Accuracy
- **Verify Examples**: Ensure all examples are correct and tested
- **Version Awareness**: Note any version-specific features
- **Link Related Docs**: Reference other relevant blocks or concepts

## Block-Specific Guidelines

### Data Blocks
- Focus on data formats, schemas, and transformations
- Include examples with different data types
- Document performance implications for large datasets

### LLM/Agent Blocks
- Provide prompt engineering examples
- Document token usage and costs
- Include examples of different response formats

### Utility Blocks
- Show integration with other blocks
- Document edge cases and limitations
- Provide performance optimization tips

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing documentation enhancements:

- [ ] All examples are practical and tested
- [ ] Error handling covers common scenarios
- [ ] FAQ addresses real user questions
- [ ] Technical details are accurate
- [ ] Writing is clear and accessible
- [ ] Format follows established patterns
- [ ] Links and references are valid
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed

## Important Notes

1. **Preserve Auto-Generated Content**: Do not modify the auto-generated tables and metadata
2. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow the existing documentation style
3. **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples rather than abstract descriptions
4. **Test Everything**: Ensure all examples and configurations actually work
5. **Security First**: Never include API keys, secrets, or sensitive data in examples
