## Example(s)

### Example 1: Retrieve all documents from a data space
- Create a `GetAllDocuments` Block.
- Set the `dataspace_id` to the ID of the data space you want to retrieve documents from.
- The Block will return a list of documents, each containing the document path and content.

### Example 2: Use in a workflow to process documents
- Set up a `GetAllDocuments` Block in a workflow.
- Provide the `dataspace_id` to specify the data space.
- After retrieving the documents, pass them to another block for processing, such as content analysis or text summarization.

## Error Handling
- If the `dataspace_id` is invalid or the data space cannot be accessed, the Block will raise an error.
- If no documents are found in the data space, the Block will return an empty list.
